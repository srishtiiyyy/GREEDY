/*
    üîé Problem: Boats to Save People
    ---------------------------------
    You are given an array `people` where people[i] is the weight of the i-th person
    and an integer `limit` which is the weight limit of a boat. Each boat can carry
    at most 2 people at the same time, provided their combined weight is at most `limit`.

    Goal: Find the minimum number of boats to carry every person.

    Approach:
    ---------
    1Ô∏è‚É£ Sort the array of people.
    2Ô∏è‚É£ Use two pointers:
        - i starting from the lightest person
        - j starting from the heaviest person
    3Ô∏è‚É£ If people[i] + people[j] <= limit, both can share a boat (move both pointers)
       Else, the heavier person goes alone (move j)
    4Ô∏è‚É£ Increment the boat count in both cases.
    5Ô∏è‚É£ Continue until i > j

    while (i <= j) {

            // Both lightest and heaviest person can share a boat
            i++;
            j--;
        } else {
            // Heaviest person goes alone
            j--;
        }
        boats++; // A boat is used in either case
